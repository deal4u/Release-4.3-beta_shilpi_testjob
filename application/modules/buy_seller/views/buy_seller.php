                                When selling your home, the last thing you want to worry about is the expense of repairing or replacing your homes major systems and appliances. Home warranties offer protection against unforeseen household repair bills. This can be a value added incentive when listing your property for sale. In addition, a home warranty can also reduce a seller’s after-sale exposure by shielding the buyer from covered repairs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have an older home, you may want to consider adding a home warranty. With newer homes constantly coming on the market, the warranty will help entice your buyer to steer your way. Home buyers logically prefer warranties that are included in the sale of a home.
