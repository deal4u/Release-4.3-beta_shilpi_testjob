                                A home warranty is a service contract that covers the repair or replacement of covered items in your home that break down due to normal wear and tear. A home warranty may also be referred to as appliance insurance, home service contract, or an appliance warranty.

                                Home warranties can not be used to replace your homeowner’s insurance. These two policies are very different. It’s important to always read your coverage and understand exactly what’s included in any warranty or insurance plan. Home warranty cost and coverage can vary tremendously.
